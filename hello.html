		Hello, world!
		This is my very first webpage (and my very first git push and pull ;))

		Cmnd Line Sequence: 
		Find the file you want to edit: cd and dir

		clone SSH or the other type of key (to create local repo pointing to cloud/git repo)

		pull (if using existing file/repo)
		add "file name" (after the above or if starting in Cmnd Prompt. NOTE: Nothing will happen in the Cmmnd Prompt Line - just carry on.)
		commit -m "add message to go with changes made"
		push
		
		Other git keywords: 
		status, log, reset
